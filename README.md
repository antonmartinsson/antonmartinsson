## Hi, I'm Anton 👋

I'm an iOS Developer who occasionally commits a thing or two to my repos here on Github when I have the time and inspiration to do so. 
Feel free to browse and try out one of my latest creations [GaugeKit](https://github.com/antonmartinsson/GaugeKit), visit [my website](https://antonmartinsson.com) or check out the [How to Play video for PlåtNiklas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-X0B4tnFPs), perhaps the world's first simultaneous AR + VR game I was part of creating during my time at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. 

Oh, you're here for my iOS apps? Makes sense! Here ya go:

</div>

Wait, that's not it? You're saying you don't care about development at all? 
Why not watch [my ten year old Youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6tFNKJKxXY) where I walk to Mordor? 🌋 </br>No really, I'm serious.
