## Hi, I'm Anton 👋

I'm an engineer who spends most of his days in the Apple development ecosystem. Occasionally, when I have the time and inspiration to do so, I commit a thing or two to my repos here on Github. 
Feel free to browse and try out my Swift Package [GaugeKit](https://github.com/antonmartinsson/GaugeKit), visit [my website](https://antonmartinsson.com) or check out the [How to Play video for PlåtNiklas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-X0B4tnFPs), perhaps the world's first simultaneous AR + VR game I was part of creating during my time at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. 

Oh, you're here for my iOS app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/se/app/cryptoverview/id1578673077?l=en">Cryptoverview</a>? Makes sense! You already missed the link reading this though. Luckily it's still over there if you need it. 👈
  
What's that? You're saying you don't care about development at all? 
<br>Why not watch [my ten year old Youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6tFNKJKxXY) where I walk to Mordor? No really, I'm serious. 🌋
